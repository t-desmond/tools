# Tools

This repository contains various tools and snippets I use. For now, it's minimal and not very organized. Expect changes and cleanup over time.

- Purpose: quick scripts/configs for infra and automation
- Status: early, rough, and evolving

Contributions and structure will improve as the repo grows.
